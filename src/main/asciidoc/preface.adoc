The Spring Data Elasticsearch project applies core Spring concepts to the development of solutions using the Elasticsearch Search Engine. We have povided a "template" as a high-level abstraction for storing,querying,sorting and faceting documents. You will notice similarities to the Spring data solr and mongodb support in the Spring Framework.
